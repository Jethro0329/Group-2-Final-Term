    <h1>What is Waste Mangement?</h1>

    <ul style="text-align: justify; font-size:20px">
      Waste Management is the process of collecting, transporting, treating, and disposing of waste in a way that minimizes its negative impacts on the environment and human health. 
      Waste can be solid, liquid, or gas, and it can come from various sources, such as households, industries, businesses, and agriculture. 
      Waste management involves different methods, such as waste segregation, composting, recycling, incineration, landfilling, and waste-to-energy. 
      Waste management is important for conserving natural resources, saving money, creating jobs, improving public health, and supporting sustainable development.

  <h2>Types of Waste:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Biodegradable Waste:</strong> This type of waste includes organic materials that can decompose naturally, such as food scraps, yard waste, and paper products. 
        When biodegradable waste breaks down, it can be used to enrich soil through composting.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Non-Biodegradable Waste:</strong> Non-biodegradable waste refers to materials that do not break down easily or at all in the environment. Common examples include plastics, glass, and metals. 
        Non-biodegradable waste can persist in the environment for long periods, contributing to pollution and environmental degradation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Recyclable Waste:</strong> Recyclable waste consists of materials that can be processed and re-manufactured into new products. Examples include paper, cardboard, certain plastics, glass, and metals. 
        Recycling helps conserve natural resources, reduces energy consumption, and minimizes waste sent to landfills.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hazardous Waste:</strong> Hazardous waste poses potential risks to human health and the environment due to its toxic, corrosive, flammable, or reactive properties. 
        This category includes materials such as batteries, electronic waste, chemicals, and certain medical waste. Proper handling, storage, and disposal are crucial to prevent harm.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Electronic Waste:</strong> Electronic waste, or e-waste, refers to discarded electronic devices and equipment, such as computers, smartphones, televisions, and appliances. 
        E-waste contains hazardous substances like lead, mercury, and cadmium, requiring special recycling methods to prevent environmental contamination and health hazards.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips for Proper Waste Management:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle:</strong> Adopting the 3R's principle involves minimizing waste generation by reducing consumption, reusing items whenever possible, and recycling materials to extend their lifecycle.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Compost Organic Waste:</strong> Composting organic waste, such as food scraps and yard trimmings, can divert it from landfills and create nutrient-rich compost for gardening and agriculture.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dispose of Hazardous Waste Properly:</strong> Hazardous waste should be disposed of at designated collection centers or hazardous waste facilities to prevent environmental pollution and health risks. 
        Never pour hazardous substances down drains or dispose of them in regular trash.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Avoid Single-Use Plastics:</strong> Reduce reliance on single-use plastics like bags, bottles, and packaging, opting for reusable alternatives whenever feasible. 
        Single-use plastics contribute significantly to pollution and harm marine life.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Support Recycling Initiatives:</strong> Encourage and participate in recycling programs in your community.
        Educate others about the importance of recycling and proper waste management practices to promote environmental sustainability.
      </li>
    </ul>
